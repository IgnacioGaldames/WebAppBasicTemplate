{"name":"Web App Basic Template","tagline":"Web App Basic Template for every day use, based on Adobe CS6 Basic Template","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\n![Web App Basic Template](http://ignaciogaldames.tk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/webapp.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Thanks \r\n\r\nThis is based on the works of @cubiq with [https://github.com/cubiq/add-to-homescreen] and @daneden with Animate [https://github.com/daneden/animate.css]\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFollow my Personal Blog http://ignaciogaldames.tk","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
